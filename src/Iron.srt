00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,251
<i>A famous man once said,</i>

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,091
<i>"We create our own demons."</i>

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,642
<i>Who said that?
What does that even mean?</i>

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,609
<i>Doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.</i>

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,330
<i>So, now, he was famous</i>

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,881
<i>and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.</i>

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,605
<i>I don't, uh...</i>

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,802
<i>I'm going to start again.</i>

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,482
<i>Let's track this from the beginning.</i>

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,371
<i>♪ Yo listen up here's a story</i>

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,809
<i>♪ About a little guy that
lives in a blue world</i>

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,645
<i>♪ And all day and all night
and everything he sees</i>

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,009
<i>♪ Is just blue like him
inside and outside</i>

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,289
<i>♪ Blue is his house
with a blue little window</i>

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,850
<i>♪ And a blue Corvette</i>

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,402
<i>♪ And everything is blue
for him and himself</i>

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,329
<i>♪ And everybody around</i>

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,846
<i>♪ 'Cause he ain't got nobody... ♪</i>

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,880
Half hour till the ball drops.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,201
- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,520
- Great speech, man!
- I got you, pal.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,290
I gave a speech? How was it?

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,646
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,761
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,841
It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,809
- Where are we going?
- Uh, to town, on each other.

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,927
Probably back in your room

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,126
because I also want to
see your research.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,201
Okay, you can see my research,

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,248
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,560
Mr Stark.

32
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,607
Ho Yinsen.

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,681
Ah, I finally met a man called "Ho."

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,767
- Come here.

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,083
I would like to
introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu.

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,646
- Oh, this guy. Hey.
- Mr Stark.

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,641
- You're a heart doctor.

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,047
She's going to need
a cardiologist after I...

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,769
- Bye.
- Perhaps another time?

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,489
<i>It started in
Bern, Switzerland. 1999.</i>

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,369
<i>- The old days.</i>
- Mr Stark!

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,847
<i>I never thought they
would come back to bite me.</i>

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,921
<i>Why would they?</i>

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,684
Oh, wow! Hey, Tony!

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,364
Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,641
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,241
Well, of course, but, Ms Hansen,

48
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,768
my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,921
Yeah, we're full.

50
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,410
Oh, wow, he made it.
He made the cut.

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,641
What floor you going to, pal?

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,210
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,481
The ground floor, actually,

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,483
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,401
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,051
- Uh...
- She'll take both.

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,401
One to throw away and one to not call.

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,167
"Advanced Idea Mechanics"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?

59
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,720
- I see that, because it's on your T-shirt.
- Aw!

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,407
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,164
Thank you, I'll call you.

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,127
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,441
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,280
I'll see you up
on the roof in five minutes.

65
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,890
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.

66
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,041
You know what I'm talking about?

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,121
I'll see you up there.

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,611
Damn betcha.

69
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,326
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,726
Well, it was.

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,529
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

72
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,601
- that governs repair...
- Wow.

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,041
...and chemically recode it.

74
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,526
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...

75
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,721
...operating system...

76
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
- ...of a living organism.
- Exactly.

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,561
- Yes.
- Wow.

78
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,641
Is that...
Can you...

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,245
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,050
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...

81
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,129
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,244
- Happy...
- Hmm. That's cute...

83
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,765
Leave her ficus alone.

84
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,927
Because...
And, no, seriously, don't.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,001
And you're starting with plants.

86
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,121
- For now, yeah.
- Huh.

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,442
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.

88
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,160
- Well, it's...
- Human application.

89
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,446
Exactly, exactly.

90
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,640
- Dendritic revitalisation.
- It's revolutionary.

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,046
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,610
...even limb regrowth.

93
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,485
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

94
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,801
Wow.

95
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,486
- In Switzerland.
- Hmm. That's better.

96
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,562
- Aw, you're seeing things.
- This week.

97
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,689
You almost
bought it, didn't you?

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,324
This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,686
Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,887
- The what?
- Down!

101
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,323
Stay down! Stay down, boss.

102
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,970
- We're good.
- Stay down.

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,168
You... You're...
You're right on me. I made it.

104
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,401
What the hell was that?

105
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,809
- What was that?
- It's a glitch in my work. It's...

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,451
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,687
It's not Y2K.

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,524
- Hey! Happy New Year!

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,841
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,286
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

111
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,441
- You good?
- Yeah.

112
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,000
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.

113
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,929
<i>So, why am I telling you this?</i>

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,809
<i>Because I had just created demons</i>

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,364
<i>and I didn't even know it.</i>

116
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,763
<i>- Yeah, those were good times.</i>

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,449
<i>Then I moved on.</i>

118
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,970
<i>After a brief soirée in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.</i>

119
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,008
<i>I forgot that night in Switzerland.</i>

120
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,764
<i>These days, I'm a changed man.</i>

121
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,927
<i>Forty-six.</i>

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,764
<i>- I'm different now.</i>

123
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,001
<i>I'm... Well...</i>

124
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,525
<i>- Forty-seven.</i>
<i>- You know who I am.</i>

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,601
Ow!

126
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,605
<i>Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...</i>

127
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,125
No. Forty-eight.

128
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,164
Micro-repeater
implanting sequence complete.

129
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,241
<i>As you wish, sir.</i>

130
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,410
<i>I've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.</i>

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,090
Which I will.

132
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,801
All right, let's do this.

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,801
Hi, DUM-E.

134
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,241
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.

135
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,209
Hey. Hey!

136
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,722
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

137
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,087
Blood on my mat. Handle it.

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,085
<i>Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?</i>

139
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,001
Focus up, ladies.

140
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,925
Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,407
<i>I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival</i>

142
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,444

143
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,480

All right, I think we got this.
Send them all.

161
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,681
Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.

162
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,121
- Slow it down just a...

163
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,161
...little bit.

164
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,560
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

165
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,601
Come on. I ain't scared of you.

166
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,241
I'm the best.

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,850
<i>As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.</i>

168
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,808
<i>I guess 72 hours is a long time

169
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,887
<i>I didn't think it could get any worse.</i>

170
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,281
<i>Then I had to go and turn on the TV.</i>

00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,608

174
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,771
<i>America.</i>

175
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,040
<i>Ready for another lesson?</i>

176
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,368
<i>In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited</i>

177
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,689
<i>until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.</i>

178
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,050
<i>Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind</i>

179
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,444
<i>and claim their land.</i>

180
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,404
<i>39 hours ago,</i>

181
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,364
<i>the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.</i>

182
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,682
<i>I... I... I did that.</i>

183
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,126
<i>A quaint military church</i>

184
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,682
<i>filled with wives and children,
of course.</i>

185
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,728
<i>The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.</i>

186
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,041
<i>The braves were</i> away.

187
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,605
<i>President Ems.</i>

188
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,048
<i>You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.</i>

189
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,845
<i>And now you've missed me again.</i>

190
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,803
<i>You know who I am.</i>

191
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,969
<i>You don't know where I am.</i>

192
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,006
<i>And you'll never see me coming.</i>

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
<i>Now that we seem to be back,</i>

194
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,205
<i>let's recap some
of the frightening developments...</i>

195
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,169
<i>American airwaves were hijacked...</i>

196
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,851
<i>The nation remains on high alert.</i>

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,600
<i>All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.</i>

198
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,009
<i>Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event</i>

199
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,203
<i>is a newly minted resource.</i>

200
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,569
<i>I know him
as Colonel James Rhodes.</i>

201
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,763
<i>The American people
will soon know him</i>

202
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,530
<i>as the tron Patriot.</i>

203
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,487
<i>And how is President Ems responding?</i>

204
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,722
<i>By taking the guy
they call War Machine</i>

205
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,450
<i>and giving him a paint job.</i>

206
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,207
<i>The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.</i>

207
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,171
<i>Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."</i>

208
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,164
<i>You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.</i>

209
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,323
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?

210
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,130
"I am Iron Patriot!" It sucks.

211
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,611
Listen. "War Machine"
was a little too aggressive.

212
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,200
All right?
This sends a better message.

213
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,523
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.

214
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,047
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,685
It's classified information, Tony.

216
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,248
Okay, there have been nine bombings.

217
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,568
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.

218
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,723
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.

219
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,927
There's no bomb casings.

220
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,328
You know I can help.
Just ask.

221
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,130
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.

222
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,890
I got bomb disposal.

223
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,564
It catches explosions in mid-air.

224
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,165
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?

225
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,891
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

226
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,560
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.

227
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,721
You're going to come at me like that?

228
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,561
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...

229
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,161
...tator.

230
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,765
Do you mind signing my drawing?

231
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,007
- If Richard doesn't mind.

232
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,206
Are you all right with this, Dick?

233
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,884
Yeah. Fine with me.

234
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,323
- What's your name?
- Erin.

235
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,444
I loved you in <i>A Christmas Story,</i>
by the way.

236
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,082
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

237
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,005
After New York, aliens... Come on.

238
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,764
They need to look strong.

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,004
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...

240
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,884
- it's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.

241
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,530
- I get it.
- It's American business.

242
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,443
That's why I said I got it.

243
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,611
- Are you okay?

244
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,281
I broke the crayon.

245
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,124
Are you okay, Mr Stark?

246
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Take it easy. Tony.

247
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,208
How did you
get out of the wormhole?

248
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,967
- Wait a minute. Tony!

249
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,480
- What did you say?
- Tony.

250
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,769
Sorry.

251
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,285
I'm just checking on the suit.

252
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,441
Okay.

253
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,126
Check the heart.

254
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,645
Is it the brain?

255
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,644
<i>No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.</i>

256
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,564
Okay, so I was poisoned?

257
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,962
<i>My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.</i>

258
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,606
- Me?

259
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,764
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.

260
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,928
Sorry, I gotta split.

261
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,287
Badge.

262
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,682
- Badge.

263
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,205
Come on, badge.

264
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,131
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.

265
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,487
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.

266
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,720
- This is an asset that we can put to use.
- Uh-huh.

267
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,811
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.

268
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,485
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that

269
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,644
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.

270
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,041
We should start
phasing it out immediately.

271
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,611
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,

272
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,966
- you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?

273
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,650
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.

274
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,451
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head of Security. Okay?

275
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,250
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

276
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,845
- However...
- I do appreciate it.

277
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,843
- ...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.

278
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,442
...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.

279
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,601
Thank you.

280
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,246
It's not a compliment.

281
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,560
It's not...
It is a compliment.

282
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,210
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.

283
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,481
- I... Yes.
- Excuse me.

284
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,528
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.

285
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,051
- Thank you.
Did you clear this 4: -00 with me?

286
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,929
Happy, we'll talk about this later,

287
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,361
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

288
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,851
How so?

289
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,480
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,

290
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,567
so it's a little awkward.

291
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,484
I don't like the sound of that.

292
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,481
Pepper.

293
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,441
Killian?

294
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,284
You look great.

295
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,965
You look really great.

296
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,327
God, you look great.

297
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,561
What on earth have you been doing?

298
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,881
Nothing fancy.

299
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,288
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.

300
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,329
And please, call me Aldrich.
