2
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:32,367
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

3
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:38,039
It is on a little world, a human world.

4
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:42,127
They would wield its power,

5
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:48,133
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

6
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:52,762
<i>He is ready to lead</i>

7
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:58,393
<i>and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.</i>

8
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:02,439
<i>A world will be his.</i>

9
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:05,734
<i>The universe, yours.</i>

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,531
<i>And the humans,
what can they do but burn?</i>

11
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:27,172
<i>All personnel,</i>

12
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,591
<i>the evacuation order
has been confirmed.</i>

13
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:02,999
How bad is it?

14
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,294
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

15
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,967
Dr Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

16
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,969
NASA didn't authorise Selvig
to go to test phase.

17
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,388
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

18
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,556
Spontaneous event.

19
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,641
It just turned itself on?

20
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,142
Where are the energy levels now?

21
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,520
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

22
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,729
How long to get everyone out?

23
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,481
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

24
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:27,941
Do better.

25
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,860
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

26
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,278
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

27
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,864
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

28
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:37,408
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

29
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:38,576
I need you to make sure

30
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,370
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

31
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:42,580
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

32
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,499
Until such time as the world ends,

33
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,459
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

34
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,003
Clear out the tech below.

35
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,256
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

36
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,841
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:54,425
With me.

38
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,429
Talk to me, Doctor.

39
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,850
Director.

40
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,726
Is there anything we know for certain?

41
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,145
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

42
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:09,148
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

43
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,652
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

44
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,112
I assume you pulled the plug.

45
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,989
She's an energy source.

46
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,367
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

47
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,577
If she reaches peak level...

48
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:24,205
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

49
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,790
But we don't have the harness.

50
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:26,958
My calculations are far from complete.

51
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,295
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

52
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,921
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

53
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,674
That can be harmful.

54
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,593
Where's Agent Barton?

55
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,469
The Hawk?

56
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:40,972
Up in his nest, as usual.

57
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,642
<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>

58
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,686
<i>I gave you this detail</i>

59
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,354
<i>so you could keep
a close eye on things.</i>

60
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:49,981
Well, I see better from a distance.
