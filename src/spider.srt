<i>It's me, Peter Parker.</i>
<i>Your friendly neighborhood...</i>

3
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:22,246
<i>... you know.</i>

4
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:25,498
<i>I've come a long way from being</i>
<i>the boy who was bit by a spider.</i>

5
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,502
<i>Back then, nothing seemed</i>
<i>to go right for me. Now...</i>

6
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,087
Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!

7
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,839
- Super cool!
- Spider-man!

8
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:34,049
<i>... people really like me.</i>

9
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:36,969
Stick around. It's gonna start again
in a couple minutes.

10
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:39,763
That's okay.

11
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,683
<i>The city is safe and sound.</i>

12
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:44,768
<i>I guess I've had something</i>
<i>to do with that.</i>

13
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,770
<i>My Uncle Ben would be proud.</i>

14
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,695
<i>I still get to school. Top of my class.</i>

15
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:56,655
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us...

16
00:03:56,864 --> 00:04:01,243
...that the energy levels
are perturbed by the electric field.

17
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:08,250
From the form of this matrix,
we can see?

18
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,335
Miss Stacy?

19
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:13,756
That only the "m equals zero
quantum states" are affected.

20
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:17,009
Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy.

21
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:24,391
Parker? You got something to add?

22
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:26,894
No, sir.

23
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,484
<i>And I'm in love</i>
<i>with the girl of my dreams.</i>

24
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,250
Hi.

25
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:54,963
Miss Watson left a ticket for me.
Peter Parker.

26
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,341
Excuse me. Sorry.

27
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:59,968
Thank you. Sorry.

28
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,394
I'm so nervous.

29
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,461
That's my girlfriend.

30
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:51,121
- I thought she was good.
- Yeah.

31
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:53,832
Harry?

32
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,501
Harry!

33
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,669
I need to talk to you.

34
00:06:58,212 --> 00:06:59,963
Explain things.

35
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:05,719
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.

36
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:11,225
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.

37
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,235
M. J!

38
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:23,737
- Peter!
- Congrats!

39
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:26,240
- Was I good?
- Good? You were great.

40
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:28,742
- You were...
- You said great.

41
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:32,496
I love my flowers, they're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.

42
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:36,583
- Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

43
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,920
- What's with you guys anyway?
- It's complicated.

44
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:42,089
Tell me again. Was I really good?

45
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:44,591
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

46
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:47,302
- Your knees were fine.
- The applause wasn't very loud.

47
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,304
Yes, it was. Well, it's the acoustics.

48
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:52,725
It's all about diffusion. It keeps
the sound waves from grouping.

49
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,769
When the sound waves,
they propagate, then it's like an...

50
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,855
You are such a nerd.

51
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:52,493
Did you see that one?

52
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:03,545
You know what?

53
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,634
I'd like to sing on-stage
for the rest of my life...

54
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:11,136
...with you in the first row.

55
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:14,390
I'll be there.

56
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:18,560
Tell me you love me.

57
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,731
I love you.

58
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:25,317
I love you so much.

59
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,153
I always have.

60
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,369
- Ready?
- Yep.

61
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,404
You can't hide here, Flint.

62
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:19,992
- I'm just here to see my daughter.
- You are an escaped convict.

63
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:23,954
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.

64
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:27,583
You're nothing but a common thief.

65
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,253
- You maybe even killed a man?
- It wasn't like that.

66
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:33,756
It wasn't.

67
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:36,050
I had good reason
for what I was doing.

68
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,384
And that's the truth.

69
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:41,972
You and the truth<i>, s</i>itting in prison,
having three meals a day together.

70
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:44,600
I live in the presence of great truth...

71
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,102
...and that is the truth
that you left behind...

72
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:50,105
...right there in that bedroom.

73
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,912
Penny.

74
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:07,539
I missed you.

75
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,377
I miss you too, Daddy.

76
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:25,891
I promise I'll make you healthy again.

77
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:29,019
Whatever it takes, I'll get the money.

78
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,356
You get out of here. Now.

79
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:45,494
I'm not a bad person.

80
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:49,456
Just had bad luck.

81
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:08,934
Peter, what is it?

82
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:12,479
It's M. J.

83
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:16,859
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Oh, Peter.

84
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:23,741
The day your Uncle Ben asked me
to marry him, we were so scared.

85
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:25,617
And excited.

86
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:27,494
And very young.

87
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:30,748
And I loved him so fiercely.

88
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,833
- And you said yes, right?
- No.

89
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,419
I wanted to say yes, but I said no.

90
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:38,338
I wasn't ready. Neither was he.

91
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,841
So we took our time.

92
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:43,469
Looked forward to it.

93
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:47,222
Didn't want to run into something
with nothing to count on but love.

94
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:51,477
A man has to be understanding...

95
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:54,730
...and put his wife before himself.

96
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,941
Can you do that, Peter?

97
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:02,321
Yeah, I think I can.

98
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:05,866
Then you have my blessing.

99
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:11,080
I hope you've considered
a proper proposal.

100
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:14,541
Your uncle had it all planned.

101
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,627
He took me to the beach
one Sunday.

102
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,630
Oh, he was a knockout
in his bathing suit.

103
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:22,341
And I didn't look too bad myself.

104
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,426
We were very good swimmers.

105
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:27,137
And it was a beautiful day
and he said:

106
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,223
"Let's swim to the island."

107
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:34,978
And at the island, we found
a perfect spot by an old tree...

108
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:38,607
...and we lay down
and looked up at the sky.

109
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,069
And then he said,
"Close your eyes, May."

110
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:44,988
And I did.
And then he said, "Open them."

111
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:46,865
And I did.

112
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:49,993
And he was holding this ring.

113
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:52,704
Dazzling...

114
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,581
...in front of me.

115
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,461
I thought it was the sun.

116
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,675
We'd be married 50 years...

117
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,429
...come August if...

118
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:16,478
So...

119
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:23,569
...I hope you'll make it very special
for Mary Jane.

120
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:27,322
Do something she'll never forget.

121
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:31,910
Give her this.

122
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:36,373
Go on. Take it.

123
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,036
- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

124
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:02,209
Listen to me. I didn't kill your father.

125
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,046
He was trying to kill me.
He killed himself.

126
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:07,923
Shut up!

127
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,319
I'm still here, Peter.

128
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,387
Hate those things.

129
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:18,655
Harry?

130
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:23,952
Harry.

131
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,455
Harry.

132
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,253
Oh, my God.

133
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,470
Harry!

134
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,224
Come on!

135
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:49,603
God.

136
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,525
- Defib.
- Two hundred.

137
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,402
And clear.

138
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,861
No response.

139
00:21:57,945 --> 00:21:59,738
- Recharge, let's go again.
- Go ahead.

140
00:21:59,863 --> 00:22:02,324
- Charging.
- And clear.

141
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:03,492
No response.

142
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:06,912
Let's recharge and do it
one more time. And clear.

143
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:14,128
Captain Stacy.

144
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,088
- What's this?
- Flint Marko.

145
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:18,382
The guy we tied
to the Ben Parker homicide.

146
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,384
- What about him?
- Broke out of Rikers.

147
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:21,844
- And?
- He's on the run.

148
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:24,221
He's in the marshlands.
I think we got him.

149
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:30,185
There he is.

150
00:22:48,829 --> 00:22:51,874
You two, take the west side.
Tommy, take the east.

151
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,921
Where did he go?

152
00:23:19,943 --> 00:23:21,570
- Capacitors charged.
- Right.

153
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:23,781
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation
on one.

154
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:27,743
- There's a change in the silicon mass.
- It's probably a bird. It'll fly away.

155
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,703
Initiating demolecularization.

156
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:01,670
- How is he?
- He's gonna be okay.

157
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:04,298
But there's been
some memory impairment.

158
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:06,050
Particularly his short-term memory.

159
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:08,260
Right now he can't
remember the accident...

160
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:10,637
...or anything that happened
to him recently.

161
00:25:10,763 --> 00:25:12,014
Is it permanent?

162
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:15,225
It could be. Only time will tell.

163
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,853
He's awake if you wanna see him.

164
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:19,313
Maybe I should wait.

165
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:22,858
No, it's fine. Just keep it brief.
I want him to rest.

166
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,170
Hey, buddy.

167
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:45,255
Hey.

168
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:47,549
Hit my head.

169
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:49,218
Yeah.

170
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,845
Doctor said I was in an accident.

171
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:53,097
Hit-and-run.

172
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:56,308
I don't remember much of anything.

173
00:25:57,768 --> 00:25:59,436
My father...

174
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:01,647
...he died, right?

175
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:06,318
This is all so weird.

176
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:11,115
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.

177
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,282
I know that face.

178
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:13,826
How you doing?

179
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,619
I don't know.

180
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:17,788
Last thing I remember, I was fine.

181
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,164
Somewhere.

182
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,041
You're still fine.

183
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,461
We love you, Harry.

184
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:27,172
It feels like...

185
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:31,552
...somehow I've been gone
for a really long time.

186
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:34,805
And now I'm back home.

187
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:37,599
It's good to have you back.

188
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,687
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask
you guys to scoot, okay?

189
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:44,189
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

190
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:46,275
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

191
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,444
Yeah. Great.

192
00:26:49,194 --> 00:26:50,738
Get some sleep.

193
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:56,785
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I think so.

194
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,621
- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

195
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,418
You have lovely friends.

196
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,712
My best friends.

197
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:11,508
I'd give my life for them.

198
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:23,367
- Yeah?
- It's me.

199
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:25,661
Hey.

200
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:28,163
Peter, you know I can't open the door.

201
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:29,832
It's stuck again?

202
00:30:30,374 --> 00:30:32,418
Just come on and help me.

203
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:34,211
I'm coming.

204
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:42,428
- Hey.
- The review.

205
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:46,390
- They hated it. They hated me.
- Well, they can't hate you.

206
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:48,892
"The young Miss Watson
is a pretty girl...

207
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,186
...easy on the eyes,
but not on the ears.

208
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:53,605
Her small voice didn't carry
past the first row."

209
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:55,899
That's ridiculous, I was right there.

210
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,568
You were in the first row.

211
00:30:57,776 --> 00:31:01,113
Yeah, this... Listen, you were great.

212
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,784
That's a critic. This is something
you're gonna have to get used to.

213
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:09,455
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.

214
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,625
This isn't about you. This is about me.
It's about my career.

215
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:17,254
I know, and I'm just saying
you can't let it bring you down.

216
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:20,090
You gotta believe in yourself
and pull yourself together.

217
00:31:20,174 --> 00:31:21,967
You get right back
on the horse and...

218
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:24,053
Don't give me the horse thing.

219
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:26,638
Try and understand how I feel.

220
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,228
It's just...

221
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:38,233
...I look at these words...

222
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:41,570
...and it's like my father wrote them.

223
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:46,992
<i>All cars. All cars in the vicinity of</i>
<i>54th and Sixth Avenue, please report.</i>

224
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,703
<i>Crane out of control,</i>
<i>approach with caution.</i>

225
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:54,708
"Go get them, tiger"?

226
00:31:56,877 --> 00:31:58,545
I'm sorry.

227
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,123
Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central.

228
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:37,126
That crane job you sent us on?
It's bigger than we thought.

229
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:40,587
We're gonna need
a major mobilization right away.

230
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,389
Shut it down at the generator. Now!

231
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:57,146
Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret:
It's my copier.

232
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,110
What is that thing
doing in my background?

233
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:31,472
They got some kind of short.
Can't shut down the crane.

234
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:34,475
Get Edison on the phone.
Kill the power to the whole block.

235
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:39,188
Are you all right?

236
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:41,065
It's coming back.

237
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,193
Oh, no.

238
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:10,886
- Oh, my God. That's Gwen.
- What?

239
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:17,434
What's she doing up there?

240
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:20,479
I just saw her last night.
She said she had a modeling gig.

241
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:23,607
- Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

242
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,484
<i>And I work at the Daily Bugle</i>.

243
00:34:26,193 --> 00:34:28,612
And I'm dating your daughter.

244
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:25,210
You okay?

245
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:27,838
Yeah, I'm fine.

246
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:29,089
Thank you.

247
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:31,592
<i>Hey, Spidey, hold on.</i>
<i>Bugle needs a photo.</i>

248
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:33,552
- Thank God you're okay.
- Daddy.

249
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:35,637
Hey. I'm the new guy.

250
00:35:35,763 --> 00:35:37,014
New guy?

251
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,600
You okay?

252
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,853
<i>From now on, I am gonna be</i>
<i>taking shots of you for the Bugle.</i>

253
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:45,773
So smile. Are you smiling?
Just kidding.

254
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,358
- They got a guy.
- Who, Parker?

255
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:53,072
Yeah, look, just between you and me,
guy's kind of an amateur.

256
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:55,866
Have you noticed his stuff
makes you look a little bloated?

257
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:58,369
Just... Yeah, a little chunky.

258
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:00,371
Okay.

259
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:03,499
But you don't have to worry about that
anymore, buddy.

260
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:13,300
Dazzle me.

261
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:24,019
Just something the boys in
the Ad Department and I whipped up.

262
00:36:24,144 --> 00:36:27,064
<i>As you know, circulation at the Bugle's</i>
<i>been pretty good.</i>

263
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:29,024
<i>Though not as good</i>
<i>as The New York Times.</i>

264
00:36:29,149 --> 00:36:32,069
<i>Or the Daily News, or the Post,</i>
<i>or several other smaller...</i>

265
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:34,154
Get on with it, you moron...!

266
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:36,240
- What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr. Jameson.

267
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:39,660
- Your wife told you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...

268
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:44,998
Thank you.

269
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,878
So I propose this campaign.

270
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:52,589
'<i>'Daily Bugle. " That's obvious.</i>

271
00:36:52,715 --> 00:36:55,926
"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.

272
00:36:56,677 --> 00:36:59,471
"It's wow." That's actually Erickson.
He goes crazy.

273
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:01,890
We gave him a couple lattes,
it's like:

274
00:37:02,182 --> 00:37:05,102
"And how." That's me again.

275
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,312
Time to take your pill.

276
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:10,232
Not that one.

277
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:12,735
Not that one.

278
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:23,245
Drink plenty of water.

279
00:37:27,124 --> 00:37:28,584
Thank you.

280
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:31,920
Continue.

281
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:38,177
- He's busy.
- I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.

282
00:37:38,302 --> 00:37:39,845
What's that smell?

283
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:43,390
That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?

284
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:45,142
It's called Go Away.

285
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,227
That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had...

286
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:50,481
...and you have had some doozies.
- Blood pressure.

287
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:52,441
Hey, where are you going?

288
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:56,737
- Who are you?
- You hired him last week. Freelance.

289
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:59,865
- I did? What's that smell?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

290
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:03,285
Can I just say I really like that shirt?
It's the crane accident.

291
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,371
- Check out the light.
- He likes my shirt.

292
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:06,622
- Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete.

293
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:08,624
You better get in there. New guy.

294
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:11,627
He's trying to sell
some Spidey photos.

295
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:14,671
Thanks.

296
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:17,800
Parker. You're late, maybe too late.
Bruckner beat you to it.

297
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:19,551
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

298
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:22,054
- But I got you this.
- But he got me this.

299
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:24,556
I didn't see you there.
How'd you get that high?

300
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:27,601
- Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
- A flagpole?
