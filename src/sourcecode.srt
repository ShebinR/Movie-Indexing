00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:19,590

16
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:53,850

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,599

19
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,912
I feel sick.

20
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:13,627
Careful!
-Oh, I am sorry!-

21
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:15,537
Right, let me help you.

22
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:17,208
No, it's ok.

23
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,063
Hey Mister..Hey!

24
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:33,866
You dropped this!
-Thanks!-

25
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:49,498
What is that?
-Chicago-

26
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:53,930
"All on board, door are closing"

27
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:05,117
"This is a chicago-down train"
You ok there, captain?

28
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:24,982
Did you see that?

29
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:33,224
You kinda freak me out.

30
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,309
No, no, no.

31
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,983
"Sean Fentress
Teacher"

32
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,590
Oh my...

33
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:20,109
Are you all right?
-I don't know, what's going on-

34
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,875
Talk to me shawn!
-I don't know who shawn is, and I don't
know who you are!-

35
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:35,289
Ok we can get off at the next stop
and forget whatever is going on here.

36
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:37,038
This papers doesn't belong to me.

37
00:06:37,078 --> 00:06:41,499
Look at me,
everything is gonna be ok!

38
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,376
Captain Stevens, this is beleagured castle

39
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:07,728
Captain Stevens, this is beleagured Castle
acknowledge transmission!

40
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,010
Captain Stevens, do you copy?

41
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:17,653
Where am I?

42
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:20,876
You are with (operation) "Beleagured Castle"
Are you functional?

43
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,969
I am dizzy. Was there a drop in height?

44
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,554
Adjusting your orientation.

45
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,439
Can you report it this time?

46
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,369
What is this ?
What is this?

47
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:42,625
Where....who I am talking to?

48
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,649
Captain report what you saw.

49
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:49,437
I don't understand it
-Where were you, before you were talking to me?-

50
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:53,832
There was an explosion.
-Coming from where?-

51
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,630
Some confusion is perfectly normal at this stage, Captain.

52
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:04,960
Do you have a visual signal?

53
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,382
Who are you?

54
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:16,077
You already have that information captain.

55
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:17,192
-I do?-

56
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,916
Recall my name.

57
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:32,525
We'll rebuild the pattern. Try to focus.

58
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:36,379
I...was on a misson

59
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:39,195
I was flying...

60
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:41,124
And then I woke up on a train.

61
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,444
Now I am here.

62
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:45,745
I need to be briefed.

63
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:48,232
What unit is this?

64
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:50,091
You are with "Beleagured Castle".
- Who? -

65
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,666
Let's start part 1 of memory pattern -
-What is "beleaguared castle?"-

66
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:58,606
The exercises will assist you.

67
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:07,989
Part1: This is a following passage
Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera cloak

68
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:11,677
in her hand were 5 play cards
-this is a joke?-

69
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,946
They were:
Queen Spade, 4 clubs

70
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:17,134
9 of clubs,
3 at heart, 9 at heart

71
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,334
Is this a red flag exercise?

72
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:25,127
End of part 1.
Part2
The following is a recording of a western screetch-owl

73
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,476
End of part 2. End of pattern.
Acknowledge

74
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,033
Acknowledge end of pattern.

75
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,003
Stand by to initiate pattern recall?

76
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,588
Go for pattern recall.

77
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:42,510
Arrange the 5 playing cards in order a descending value irrespective of their suit.

78
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:45,464
Queen, two nines, four and a three
-That is correct-

79
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:49,670
The passage I read contained mention of a woman's name.
What was that name?

80
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:50,784
Her name is Lilly.

81
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,716
That's correct
Recall my name.

82
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,445
Goodwin, your name is goodwin, Captain.

83
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:00,956
That is correct, welcome back, captain.

84
00:10:14,726 --> 00:10:20,168
Ma'm, I need to talk to my father.
Has anybody been notified that I am state-side?

85
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,541
Who bombed the train, captain?

86
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,978
What?
-Who bombed the train?-

87
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:27,836
A woman kept calling me "Sean".

88
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,635
That is incidental
Think captain, remember back.

89
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,075
Who bombed the train?

90
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:34,197
I don't know who bombed the god damn train.

91
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:37,512
Then go back and try again.
-Back where?-

92
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:39,658
You will have 8 minutes, same as last time.

93
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:46,565
No, No, no more bullshit semi-tests.
I need to know, where I am, what is the location and condition of my crew.

94
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:49,486
Does anybody know, that I am stateside?

95
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,265
You are obligated to give me this information!
-Start with the bomb!-

96
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:55,132
Where is it and what does it look like.

97
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:57,617
What kind of explosive, how is it detonated.
-Right, right-

98
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:00,619
Find the bomb and you'll find the bomber.
-Find the bomb....wait nooo!-

99
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:20,377
I took your advice, it was good advice. Thank you.

100
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:21,761
Yeah, its good.

101
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,473
And I signed to a law-course.
Next thing you know, I'll be moving to india to find myself.

102
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:30,283
Laws....
Know any good Gurus?

103
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:37,263
On your shoe...

104
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,609
So what do you think, am I on the right track?

105
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:43,871
It's the same train but it's different.

106
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:48,925
Deep. I hope it's different.
I feel the same way.

107
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:53,298
What?

108
00:11:56,331 --> 00:12:01,141
-Go ahead-
What is with guys, everything is beatiful in retrospect.

109
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,895
This looks so real.

110
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:10,501
You know, I think it'll be really good for me to get away from him
as far as possible

111
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:12,922
Unbelieveable details.
-Ticket-

112
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:14,694
May I see your ticket?

113
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,413
Thanks.

114
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:27,094
The doer wouldn't place you right of me.

115
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:30,195
You are a pretty girl. a distraction.

116
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,035
A "distraction"?
-Every simulator has one-

117
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:34,510
Hey are we gonna make up the two minutes?
-We are gonna try-

118
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,578
Are you talking about Brian?
-Hey Grandpapa-

119
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,434
what the heck was the delay back there?

120
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:41,279
What you late for?

121
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:44,462
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?

122
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:47,466
I have be at a festival with assholes...like you!

123
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:49,816

-Thank you-
-You welcome-

129
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:13,263
You are welcome.
"Mainbruck station"

130
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:17,072
Damn it!

131
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:19,579
Ah, I am sorry.

132
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,195
Hey Mr., hey

"All aboard, doors are closing"

135
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:16,927
Explosion came from behind me.

136
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,959
What's with you ?

137
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:23,900
I don't have time to talk to you right now

138
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:25,486
I got time for you

139
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:30,782
Next stop : "Chicago, Union-Station"

140
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:14,586
Holy shit...

141
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:32,028
Goodwin, you have to tell me, how to disarm this.

142
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:42,755
Ehmm...should I unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it?

143
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,159
Ok, ehmm

144
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:51,846
I am just gonna leave it.

145
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:55,897
ok?

146
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,755
"Sean Fentress,
Teacher"

147
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:23,625
Ladies and Gentleman, Transit Security

148
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:24,513
No, you're not.

149
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,371
We have a classified security-breach and I want you turn off
your personal electronic devices till we reach another station

150
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,087
That means laptops
Cellphones
Cellphones Sir!
Thank your very much.

151
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:37,837
Pagers, anything electronic.
It's a precautionary measure, nothing to worry about.

152
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:40,213
So which is it, security breach or precautionary measure.

153
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:40,991
Sir!

154
00:16:41,094 --> 00:16:41,794
Sir!

155
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,363
Is there a problem, Sir?
-I am in the middle of a very big deal-

156
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:47,861
Sean?

157
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:49,004
I need you to turn that off.

158
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,558
Why you don't show my your id again?

159
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:51,234
Sean!

160
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,577
Turn it off!

161
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:53,838
What's your problem, asshole?

162
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:54,992
Hey!

163
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,429
Sean, what are you doing ?

164
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:01,532
Not a good idea m'am.

165
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:03,288
I think , you broke his jaw.

166
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:05,200
It's ok, he is not any more real than you are.

167
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,639
I am not real?
How about next time you drive to work !

168
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,298
There's not gonna be a next time.

169
00:17:27,492 --> 00:17:29,032
stabilized?

170
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:34,519
Lower your pulse.

171
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:44,287
Did you find the bomb?
-Yes-

172
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:49,651
There is a strange hydraulic fluid all over the floor.

173
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:51,932
It's not a concern, captain.

174
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:54,154
Tell me about the bomb.

175
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:59,730
Where is that man? I saw a guy with a crutch on my monitor.

176
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:03,536
He looks like he is in charge, I wonna talk to him.
-Thats irrelevant captain-

177
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:08,044
I wonna talk to your commanding officer!
-You can talk to him upon completion of your mission-

178
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:14,341
My mission is in Afghanistan, where my unit is.
I flew two god damn missions yesterday.

179
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:18,584
You've been with us for 2 months.

180
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:26,443
Did you id the bomber?
-No, where is my unit?-

181
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:30,728
And under who's leadership is this simulation?

182
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:34,427
Captain, this is not a simulation. Lives are depending on you.

183
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:36,465
What lives?

184
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:39,853
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.

185
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:42,091
No, what lives, what you are talking about?

186
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:44,303
I need to be briefed!

187
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:58,345
Sir, I need to give him something.
-That's fine, go ahead-

188
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:01,980
Get ready to sent him back out.

189
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:16,562
At 7:48 this morning, a bomb exploded in a commuter train outside of chicago, killing
everyone on board.

190
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:18,502
and thats the train, you been on.

191
00:19:18,641 --> 00:19:22,362
No no, I am right here,
you are talking to me.. right now!

192
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,093
A man named Sean Fentress was on that train.

193
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:30,209
In a sense....he is now you.

194
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:36,436
Every second spend, explaining things puts more innocents  civilians at risk.

195
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:37,874
This makes no sense.

196
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:42,771
The train explosion was the first attack of a series.
There are going to be more.

197
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,810
Now, did you find the bomb?

198
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:51,487
In the restroom, ventilation-panel above the sink.

199
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:57,806
cellphone-detonator.
Are we done?

200
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:02,028
Eh, no no. But thats good, thats very very good, captain.
good.

201
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:07,872
Our records show, that 1812 calls ended at the moment of the explosion.

202
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:13,942
52 of those calls were received by cell tower nearby and reversed to the train. So one of those calls was made by our bomber.

203
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,733
Do you remember a freight train passing by, just before the explosion?

204
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:18,394
Yes.

205
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:24,920
The explosion was timed to engulf the passing freight train
which means, the bomber had be watching both trains
when the call was made.

206
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:29,471
52 callers.... one of those is our bomber.

207
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:31,475
I want you to concentrate on the passengers in your car.

208
00:20:31,818 --> 00:20:40,936
Get to know them, narrow suspectpool.
Look for ones, who seem quite or withdrawn, who seem nervous.

209
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:44,007
As always, you have 8 minutes.

210
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,447
8 minutes, and I blow up again?

211
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:48,948
Yes

212
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:59,151
I need you to discipline yourself on this next path.
Perform only the task, that we assign you.
Everything else is irrelevant.

213
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:01,004
Start the sequence.

214
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:02,777
...is my father even...

215
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:18,909
I took your advice...
it was very good advice

216
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:23,859
You're kinda quite today?
-Just got a lot on my mind.-

217
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:25,572
Carefull !

218
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:26,263
Oops

219
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:28,306
Oh, I am so sorry
-Don't worry about it-

220
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:34,803
That's very kind of you.

221
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,045
You're very decent.

222
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:46,974
Thank you.

223
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:52,128
And real.
-Ticket!-

224
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:55,747
How you doing today?
-good-

225
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:58,635
Anything unusual?
-Ehmm no-

226
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:05,274
I mean behavior on the train.
Is anything or anybody seems strange to you?

227
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:06,799
You look strange.

228
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,457
How about you,
does anybody looks suspicious?

229
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:17,087
Are you drunk or something?
-Come here-

230
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:20,092
For a second.

231
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:23,756
come on.

232
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,602
Just think of it as a game.
-A game?-

233
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:43,781
They are all so utterly normal, Sean.
That's what so terrifying about them.

234
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:47,167
Maybe there is a team network.

235
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,227
The sleeping giant coache with the ministry and the comedian.

236
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:59,507
Don't forget the student, he is expendable.
But they are all controlled by the conductor.

237
00:22:59,564 --> 00:23:03,210
Standing there like a king and demanding tickets.

238
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,640
You are funny.
-Damn it-

239
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:10,518
What about that guy?
-Deposition-

240
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:12,464
And the woman who is sitting cross him?

241
00:23:12,506 --> 00:23:16,958
Hair appointment, every monday, you know this.
You know this people better than me.

242
00:23:17,457 --> 00:23:20,751
And the guy behind her?
He's late for an audition, right?

243
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:26,875
Or audition to the court
he got caught driving drunk twice.

244
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,970
-Hey, hows the signal in here?-
Good

245
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:34,815
Is teaching not stimulating enough for you anymore, Sherlock?

246
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:44,878
Oh oh, the toilet ist sure jammed now.
-Did anyone else come out of the bathroom?-

247
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,336
Well, I saw you coming out of there.
-Me?

248
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:48,800
Yes.
-No-

249
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:52,862
Me?
-Hey Mr.-

250
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:57,283
Hold on a second.

251
00:23:57,325 --> 00:23:59,693
What's in here.

252
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:02,711
A broken phone.

253
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:04,212
What is this.

254
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,364
Coffee with Christina.

255
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:13,389
Christina?
-Yeah-

256
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:15,085
Excuse me.

257
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,736
Hey,  hey come with me.
-This isn't our stop!-

258
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,788
come on, let's take a walk.
-We don't get off here.-

259
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,870
I don't know, just be spontaneaous.
-You start freaking me out-

260
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:42,050
I know this sounds a bit weird
but I have a really bad feeling about this train
and that we should get off, ok?

261
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:45,046
Just get your stuff.

262
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:47,526
Doors are closing.

263
00:24:54,652 --> 00:24:56,458
Come on, come with me.

264
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:01,889
So what now?
-Wait here, I will be right back!-

265
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:38,384
Ready for coffee now?

266
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:41,799
Oh sorry, ah yea yea,
just one more second, ok?

267
00:26:54,086 --> 00:26:55,256
Oh for god's sake.

268
00:26:58,669 --> 00:26:59,678
Feeling Sick?

269
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:03,341
Motion sickness, I get it all the time.

270
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:08,065
Excuse...

271
00:27:14,628 --> 00:27:16,530
Are you following me?
-Can I borrow your phone?-

272
00:27:18,126 --> 00:27:19,962
No, I don't have one.

273
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:22,291
Sure?
-Yea, I am sure-

274
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:25,609
Why you dont leave me alone please?
Or I call the police.

275
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:28,178
With what?
I thought, you didn't have a phone.

276
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:33,847
You know, you have no right....

277
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,992
Gimme my bag back.

278
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:42,796
Are you crazy

279
00:27:45,775 --> 00:27:47,826
Sean!
-Get back!-

280
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,125
Sean, what's going on?

281
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,432
Sean

282
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,413
Sean

283
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,097
It wasn't you.
-What the hell is wrong with you?

284
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:11,539
Are you insane?
-No-

285
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:17,137
Where is it???
-Get away from me please!-

286
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,845
Sean, Sean
get off!

287
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:26,211
Listen to me, get up!

288
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:33,782
Sean
-Gimme your hand, get off the track-

289
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:57,425
Goodwin
Come on, do you here me?

290
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:07,095
Captain Stevens, this is beleaguared castle
do you copy? please respond

291
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:14,026
It's freezying here, whats going on.

292
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:20,878
What's that

293
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:26,045
He is in trouble.

294
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:29,520
I think the oxygen just went out.

295
00:29:34,264 --> 00:29:35,321
Goodwin

296
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:40,186
Goodwin!

297
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,586
Find a way to get through to him.

298
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:12,781
What is it?
What's going on?

299
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:21,238
It's not the tertiary cooling ether.

300
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:32,104
Just keep sending strings up,
maybe he hooks on to something.

301
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:43,119
It's hard to tell what exactly he is going through.

302
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,225
Sir...
-Lord, please-

303
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:54,937
It's not a lot we can do from here.

304
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:04,798
If nothing changes, who much time do we have?
-Some-

305
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:08,226
and not long

306
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:11,205
Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera cloak,
she had 5 playing cards in her hand...

307
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:23,478
Goodwin, you out there?

308
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:30,500
Goodwin, who is Goodwin.
-This is Captain Stevens, do you copy-

309
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:33,541
Captain Stevens?

310
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:35,799
The capsule lost power

311
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,927
The capsule?
Is that where you are now, in a capsule?

312
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:45,350
You should know, who are you?
-Let me get captain Goodwin for you-

313
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,842
You invented this thing, right?

314
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,767
I did.
-Are you in command here ?-

315
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:53,678
I am... were you able to locate information we need,
captain?

316
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:59,862
Negative Sir, I was unable to find the bomber, but I did safe her.
A passenger on the train.

317
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:01,331
I got her off safely, a woman

318
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:07,351
Captain, it's gonna be contra-prodactive for you to safe anyone on the train. They're outside the mission.

319
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:11,160
Well, she survived.
And maybe this will work with the rest too.

320
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:14,448
She survived, but only inside of the source code.
None of them will be safe.

321
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,637
What is this source code?

322
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:20,808
Its quantum mechanics parabolic calculus.
It's very complicated.

323
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:22,213
Try me!

324
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,268
Fine.

325
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:31,341
When a light blub turned off, there is an afterglow, halo-effect.
You seen it?

326
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:33,100
Yes
-Of course-

327
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:38,839
The brain is like that, it's electromegnatic field remains charged,
just briefly, even after death.

328
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:40,038
Cicruits remain open.

329
00:33:40,804 --> 00:33:47,124
Now there is another curiosity about the brain.
It contains a short-term memory track that's about 8 mins long.

330
00:33:47,882 --> 00:33:53,280
like a convenient store's security camera
that only records the last part of the activities of the day on his harddrive.

331
00:33:53,331 --> 00:34:00,528
Now combining this two phenomena,
hardware that remains viable after death
and a memory bank that goes back 8 Minutes

332
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:05,182
Source code enables us to exploir the overlap

333
00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:10,493
Sean Fentress died on this train, of all the passengers
aboard he was your best link.

334
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:15,736
you two share the compatibility in terms of gender,
body-size and your synaptic maps.

335
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:19,719
What happens after the 8 minutes?
-After, nothing-

336
00:34:19,762 --> 00:34:27,890
you cease to exist on the train.
You can't  exist inside the source code, beyond Fentresse's 8 minutes...

337
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:33,225
Source Code is not time travel...

338
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:37,508
Source Code is time-reassignment.

339
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:43,422
It gives us access to a parallel reality.
Now the deaths on the train were a tragedy

340
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:47,190
, but source code
enpowers us...
-But I saved....-

341
00:34:47,238 --> 00:34:52,334
one person.
That girl, that's always sitting across of me.
I pulled her off the train.

342
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,833
Give me her name.

343
00:34:55,556 --> 00:34:59,384
Christina, I don't remember her last name.

344
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,463
Her name is Christina Warren
-Yes!-

345
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,778
She was 28
-That's her-

346
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:15,906
born in Illionois
Died this morning on the train.

347
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:18,245
No, I pulled her off.
She's fine.

348
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:22,702
No, she isn't.
-Believe me, she is-

349
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:25,255
She saw me get hit by the express train.

350
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:28,594
This isn't getting us anywere.

351
00:35:28,636 --> 00:35:32,259
We have to send him in again. A second attack is imminent, Dr. Brudlegde.

352
00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:35,598
What second attack?
-The train was just the beginning-

353
00:35:35,643 --> 00:35:39,747
A letter of intent.
-I am sorry, what are you telling me here?-

354
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:45,490
we have information that downton Chicago is the next target
And they're planning to detonate a dirty bomb.

355
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:50,960
You have any idea how many people would die if
that bomb detonates in the city?

356
00:35:51,513 --> 00:35:55,285
We're evacuating as we speak.
We've to stop that this happens, do you understand?

357
00:35:55,431 --> 00:36:00,509
If you find the bomber, his second attack, his real attack, we think, can be prevented.

358
00:36:00,562 --> 00:36:04,064
We have very little time left.
Up here the clocks are only moving in one direction.

359
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:05,379
Charge the drivers.

360
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:12,791
On the upper deck of the next carriage
there is a conductor's compartment.
It's a small office containing a safe.

361
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:18,222
Inside is a loaded handgun.Get to it.
You are authorized to use whatever force necessary.

362
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,955
You're still here.
-Of course I am-

363
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,500
Guess what.

364
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:40,329
You've quit your job and signed to a law course.

365
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:43,048
Good guess.

366
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:44,962
spilled coffee

367
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:52,653
Listen to me...
Don't answer that, you deserve better than that guy.

368
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,069
Everything looks better in retrospect, doesn't?

369
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,554
How did you know there was

370
00:36:58,597 --> 00:37:02,512
How well do you know me?
-Not that well apparently-

371
00:37:02,662 --> 00:37:08,334
You know me well enough, that you would trust me, if
I am acting a little bit strange or even dangerous, would you do that?

372
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,481
No

373
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:15,689
Wow, that was honest.

374
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:21,646
You are beatiful, you're kind,
and you are painfully honest

375
00:37:22,297 --> 00:37:26,312
Who are you and what did you do to Sean Fentress?
-It's the new me-

376
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:43,697
I don't want to hurt you.

377
00:38:49,587 --> 00:38:54,420
No I am not gonna sit in my seat.
He is bleeding, he needs medical attention.

378
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:57,779
Is it true, you tried to steal a gun out
of the train security box?

379
00:38:58,225 --> 00:39:00,332
Careful ma'm!

380
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:05,344
What were you thinking?
-Can I borrow your phone?

381
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:07,205
No, you need to go to the hospital,  Sean.
-Please, I need your phone!-
-

382
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:08,721
You need help, NO,

383
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,181
why do you want my phone?

384
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,230
What would you do if you had only one minute left to live?
-I don't know-

385
00:39:22,366 --> 00:39:31,778
I would call my dad, I wonna hear his voice
and then tell him, I am sorry

386
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,884
Tell me everything is gonna be ok.
-Everything is gonna be ok-

387
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:44,912
-Everything is gonna be ok-

388
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:02,236
Oh yea, the gun in the strongbox, that was a
really great idea. Thanks for that.

389
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:05,794
Did you make any progress?
-Can I get access to a phone?-

390
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:07,991
I need to talk to my father.

391
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:12,831
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes, I will try....

392
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:21,568
Goodwin, how I am doing?
I am just trying to measure my performance here.

393
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:24,402
have you ever gotten back in?
I am doing any better than you did?

394
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:28,570
No, we're wasting valueble time here.

395
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:44,070
No, no, I had never been on the other side
of a source code mission. I wouldn't be viable candidate for it.

396
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:47,006
Why not?
(CAOC-N, what is that?)

397
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:50,782
Because the specifactions are extremely narrow.

398
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:52,079
What are they?

399
00:40:52,318 --> 00:41:01,893
Captain, you should have found the suspect by now.
This tactical advantage, this termendous tool we've given you.
Don't waste it by thinking.

400
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,290
Do.

401
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,887
Please contact my father for me.

402
00:41:05,928 --> 00:41:11,077
This will stop at some point, captain.

403
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:19,627
as soon you finish the mission.
And you doing really great. This will end.

404
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:29,209
Whoever planted the bomb, had equipment of some kind.
Gloves, screw-driver, flashlight, something....

405
00:41:29,271 --> 00:41:33,307
Check bags, backpacks, briefcases, anything.

406
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:37,849
So...I took your advice.

407
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:41,095
very good advice.

408
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:57,804
What are you doing?
-I am just...-

409
00:41:57,846 --> 00:41:58,972
trying to rember something

410
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:01,746
What is that?
-It's a military patch-

411
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,348
were you in the military?

412
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:11,560
A friend of mine was
He was in afghanistan and he disappeared and no one
heared from him since.

413
00:42:16,591 --> 00:42:19,431
Do you have Internet on your phone?

414
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:23,706
No it's just connacted to the office
by a really long piece of string.

415
00:42:25,932 --> 00:42:28,995
Do you think, you can see what you can find
on this guys?

416
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,760
He has been on my mind a lot lately,
His name is Captain Colter Stevens,
he is in the 17th airborn.

417
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,972
Ok you owe me.

418
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:38,816
I'll buy you a cup of coffee...
-I get one for you now-

419
00:42:40,548 --> 00:42:46,028
Christina
Ehmm, I been having this dreams lately...

420
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,468

421
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:55,286
and you been in them?
-really?-

422
00:42:55,336 --> 00:43:00,492
What...no...
No that I wouldn't its just...

423
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:28,085
I call you back in a minute honey.

424
00:43:28,136 --> 00:43:30,829
Learning?
-Yea-

425
00:43:31,457 --> 00:43:32,179
For what?

426
00:43:32,216 --> 00:43:37,568
Ehh, psychology..
I got a big test this morning, so I should get back to it

427
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:45,198
Can I borrow your pen?
-Yea, sure-

428
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:50,019
Hey, that's not cool man.

429
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:54,342
The bag is a mess.
-What you doing man?-

430
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:58,809
never find what I am looking for,
just like my bag.

431
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:01,612
How about you let the guy have his bag back?
-Finish your deal!-

432
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:04,022
Stay out of this tough guy
or doesn't end well for you.

433
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:11,522
You can't do that.

434
00:44:12,992 --> 00:44:16,394
Dick.
(Walter Reed military center)

435
00:44:31,093 --> 00:44:35,901
Excuse me, ma',m. How you doing, good morning.
You working at Walter Reed?

436

00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:40,356
Ehm,

-You are in the military?-

438
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,709
Yea I am.
-I mean, what was going on down there?-

439
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:53,437
Oh you know, but we were a little
argument about this patch.

440
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:58,522
Is that what they train you to do? Assault civilians?
-Ma'm please do any of these letter come familiar to you?

441
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:04,776
do you know what the "n" stands for?
-It's airforce, and the "n" stand for nellis-
