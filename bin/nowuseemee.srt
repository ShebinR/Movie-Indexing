1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,764
<i>Come in close.</i>

2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,366
<i>Closer.</i>

3
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,244
<i>Because the more you think you see,</i>

4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,766
<i>the easier it'll be to fool you.</i>

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,289
<i>Because what is seeing?</i>

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,405
<i>You're looking, but what you're really
doing is filtering, interpreting,</i>

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,448
<i>searching for meaning.</i>

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,680
<i>My job?</i>

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,765
<i>To take that most precious ot gifts
you give me, your attention,</i>

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,722
<i>and use it against you.</i>

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,087
I'm going to flip through this deck.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,650
And I want you to see one card.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,171
Not this one. That's too obvious.

14
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,891
Pay close attention.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,771
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,046
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,121
Okay.

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,969
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,043
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,969
Now, do you see your card here?

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,567
No.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,847
That's because you're looking too closely.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,968
And what have I been telling you all night?

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,530
The closer you look...

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,170
The less you see.

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,806
Now look into my eyes.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
And sleep. Okay.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,566
And...

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,326
If you can get this bill from me,
you can have it.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,363
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,086
If you can say your name, you can have it.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,641
All right, just hang out
there, wriggle a sec.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,121
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,801
- of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,966
I'm picturing...

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,007
Don't tell me. Um...

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,161
Of course.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,242
Beach. Cocktails.

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,851
Florida?

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,450
Look, it was a business trip.

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,642
I mean, it is a kind of business.

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,610
Maybe the oldest business.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,926
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,565
She can't move, Mack.

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,051
You're thinking of a woman's name.

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,049
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,361
Who's Janet?

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,200
You know Janet?

49
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,641
It's not your best friend, is it?

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,565
- Your sister?
- No, please.

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,882
Her sister? Oh, my God.

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,003
You weren't away on business.

53
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,969
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,241
Your wife's sister!

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,525
Okay, we need to move over here,

56
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,410
because it seems like
she's a little bit upset right now.

57
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,170
You want this to go away?

58
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,570
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

59
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,451
Come on, get it out.

60
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,966
Do you shake down everybody like this?

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,764
No, only the special few.

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,002
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

63
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,003
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

64
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,081
You're a stick-up artist.

65
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,884
Yeah. Of course.

66
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,967
Okay, and sleep!

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,005
Now, when I snap my fingers,

68
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,570
you won't remember any of this.

69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,846
And you, Warren Beatty,

70
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,924
every time you see or even think of Janet,

71
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,726
you're gonna picture me naked.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
And that's not a pretty sight.

73
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,041
Yeah.

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,282
And... You're wide awake!

75
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,681
Well, we did the best we could,

76
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,122
but some people just
aren't to be hypnotized.

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,487
- Oh. I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

78
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,284
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

79
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,646
Look after her.

80
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,449
Just have to hit an ATM first.

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,321
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

82
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,528
and I will give $100

83
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,127
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

84
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,482
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,647
right here in Brooklyn.

86
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,966
Check it out.

87
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,046
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,601
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

89
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,047
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,805
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

91
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,531
Look at this!
Looks like we got a spoon and a stem.

92
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,006
I've got other tricks.

93
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,521
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,801
You said you would.

95
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,166
Nice wallet.

96
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,440
You have a very good eye, sir.

97
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,521
Thanks.

98
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,681
Wallet.

99
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,362
My wallet. My watch!

100
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,087
Stop that guy!

101
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,201
Stop that guy in the leatherjacket!

102
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,321
He's got my wallet!

103
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,962
Whoo! Okay, Los Angeles,
are we ready to end this thing?

104
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,401
Yeah!

105
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,483
When that timer hits zero,

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,921
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

107
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,769
will fall from above.

108
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,531
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

109
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,571
One, two, three!

110
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,161
Yeah!

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,204
Help! Stop it!

112
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,049
She's serious! She can't get out!

113
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,848
- Go get some help!

114
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,041
Help, dude!

115
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,882
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

116
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,570
Come on! This is bullshit!
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

117
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,041
Yes!

118
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,491
I am your biggest fan.

119
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,529
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

120
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,965
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

121
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,371
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

122
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,767
Whoa!

123
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,171
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

124
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,851
How did you do that...

125
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,160
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

126
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,685
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

127
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,080
- Uh-uh.

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,367
I'll give you a hint. It involved,
uh, bribing the tower electrician.

129
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,602
- How much?
- Uh, 50 bucks.

130
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,763
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

131
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,961
Is it always a seven?

132
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,641
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

133
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,569
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,126
I'll see what I can do.

135
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,129
Ooh! Magic man!

136
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,851
Ah! I love your shampoo.

137
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,882
- Whoa! Hold up.
- What?

138
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,847
You need to leave.

139
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,961
Are you kidding me?

140
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,122
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

141
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,409
Is this what you do?
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

142
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,722
"45 East Evan Street."

143
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,405
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

144
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,931
You don't have my number.

145
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,969
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

146
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,725
Oh, you are such an asshole.

147
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,726
I'm going to go with her.

148
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,521
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

149
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,687
Go ahead!

150
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,330
That's on you, Fuller.

151
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,965
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

152
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,167
Daniel?

153
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,487
Hey!

154
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,647
Henley.

155
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,042
Danny? Hey.

156
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,808
- Ah. You got a card, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,123
No, no, no, it's good for you. Congratulations.
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

158
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,565
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

159
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,007
You wait out here. I will come back
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

160
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,884
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

161
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,406
Nice hair.

162
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,324
So, um, actually,
what have you been up to?

163
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,482
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

164
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,325
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

165
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,244
You have a website. That's good.
Good for you. Get the word out.

166
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,641
- Oh.
- Uh...

167
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,450
Okay.

168
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,729
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

169
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,406
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

170
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,641
Yeah. Excuse me.

171
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,563
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

172
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,251
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me. Uh...

173
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,890
Helen? No, no.

174
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,241
Henley.

175
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,766
It's on your coffee cup.

176
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,331
Thanks for keeping me honest.

177
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,411
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.
It was just an observation.

178
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,087
Second observation, you are beautiful.

179
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,328
Thank you.

180
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,080
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

181
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,447
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

182
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,364
Very nice. I know who you are
and I just want to say that

183
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,441
I'm not interested in you doing

184
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,601
your mentalism thing on us.

185
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,206
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

186
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,284
Shh! Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you

187
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,044
are a control freak.

188
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,366
I'm sorry, have we met before?

189
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,925
It doesn't take a mentalist
to figure that out.

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,047
You are a control freak.

191
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,481
Well, I take that as a compliment.

192
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,566
Only he would take it as a compliment.

193
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,962
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

194
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,249
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

195
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,527
A couple? No, no.

196
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,840
We were never a couple.

197
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,530
He used to saw me in half.

198
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,847
She was a very good assistant.

199
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,961
But I was too fat for Danny.

200
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,725
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

201
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,724
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

202
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,641
No one could fit through there. No one.

203
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,841
- Rebecca fit through.
- Ah...

204
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,610
Rebecca fit for years.

205
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,404
Do you know how hard it is to stay

206
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,323
in those tiny little costumes?

207
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,409
No. I'm the main attraction.

208
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,529
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

209
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,605
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

210
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,051
That's a really nice story.

211
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,840
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

212
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,281
No way.

213
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,090
J. Daniel Atlas?

214
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,606
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

215
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,001
You're like...

216
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
I idolize you. Seriously.

217
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,965
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

218
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,485
I'm Jack, by the way.

219
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,171
Question. Did you get one of these?

220
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,042
Yeah. Death.

221
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,206
The High Priestess.

222
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,406
I'm the Lover.

223
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,601
Three minutes.

224
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,721
Hermit.

225
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,571
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

226
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,091
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

227
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,800
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

228
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,607
Hmm.

229
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,323
What is this place?

230
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,606
- Ugh!
- Oh!

231
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,290
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

232
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,082
Man, it's freezing in here.

233
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,807
What's that?

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,206
I don't know.

235
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,481
What's it say?

236
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,290
"Now you don't."

237
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,402
"A rose by any other name..."

238
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,970
Guys, what's happening?

239
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,641
Whoa.

240
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,480
Look at that.

241
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,161
Whoa.

242
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,606
It's gas!

243
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,922
Relax. Just dry ice.

244
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,721
Cool.

245
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,045
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

246
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,765
Hang on. Hang on.

247
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,966
I got nothin'.

248
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,889
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

249
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,969
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

250
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,164
Okay, so you're like Buddha,
if he wasn't so enlightened.

251
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,645
And you're like Jesus,

252
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,291
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

253
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,603
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

254
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,806
No. Wait, did you?

255
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,211
I wish.

256
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,967
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

257
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,961
Oh, great.

258
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,085
Electricity is out.

259
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,765
Well, let's check.

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,047
Whoa.

261
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,285
Blueprints.

262
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,445
They're incredible.

263
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,291
Who do you think did this?

264
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,522
I don't know, but I
really want to meet them.

265
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,124
It's a show.

266
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,721
Wow.

267
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,371
<i>Merritt McKinney,</i>

268
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,451

273
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,006
Thank you.

274
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,487
Tonight we would like to try something

275
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,006
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

276
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,767
For our final trick,
we're gonna do something never before

277
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,842
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

278
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,161
Or any stage for that matter.

279
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,445
Ladies and gentlemen,

280
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,841
tonight

281
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,524
we are going to rob a bank.

282
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,602
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

283
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,046
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

284
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,687
One, two, three!

285
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,688
Sorry, sir. There's absolutely no recording
allowed during the performance.

286
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,330
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

287
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,920
- Let me just put this away.

288
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,206
Actually, I need to take that.

289
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

290
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,561
Okay.

291
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,769
Okay, okay.

292
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,889
Now, please, please, settle down.

293
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,444
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

294
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,682
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

295
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,569
So we'll choose one at random then.

296
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,686
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

297
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,761
Thank you, Merritt.

298
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,604
We are looking at row number 5.

299
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,721
Where is that?

300
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,764
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

301
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,210
Oh. Lucky number 13.

302
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,201
- B-5-13. Where are you?

303
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,881
Sir, please, stand up.
Ah, there you are. Hi.

304
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,320
Could you just confirm for me that this
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

305
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,367
Yes.

306
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,442
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

307
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,000
your name and the name of your bank?

308
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,281
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

309
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,888
And my bank, it's Credit
Republicain de Paris.

310
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,241
French. Okay. Uh...

311
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,885
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

312
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,321
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

313
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,368
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

314
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,721
Could you please come up to the stage

315
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,171
- and we'll rob your bank.

316
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,129
And while he does that...

317
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,529
There is someone here tonight
without whom we would just be

318
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,769
four magicians working the circuit,
trying to get...

319
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,331
Well, actually, trying to get here.

320
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,324
You probably know this man,
if not from one of the many, many

321
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,521
companies he puts his name on.

322
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,207
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.
Mr. Arthur Tressier.

323
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,288
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

324
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,290
The only man here with
the Queen's cell phone number.

325
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,242
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

326
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,408
I want to say that when we came
to Mr. Tressier,

327
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,207
we promised that, as a unit, we could
become the biggest name in magic.

328
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,805
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

329
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,729
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

330
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,723
we made sure we put your name on top.

331
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,205
If you turn out to be as good
as you think you are, dear girl,

332
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,328
that won't be necessary much longer.

333
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,846
We haven't done our closer yet.

334
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,081
- Why don't you watch it

335
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,366
and then you can decide for yourself.

336
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,727
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressier!

337
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,484
Thank you.
And, of course, once again,

338
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,528
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

339
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,209
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

340
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,921
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

341
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,207
You will need to wear this, as it will allow
you to literally fold through space and time

342
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,602
to your bank in the...

343
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,801
8th?

344
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,963
- 9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

345
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,131
Now, once you are there, we will be able
to speak with you through this helmet.

346
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,964
- Now if... Ah!
- Ow.

347
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,844
- Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

348
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,810
It has the added attraction of being
very stylish.

349
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,327
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

350
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,806
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

351
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,530
- Thank you. Thank you...
- It is.

352
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,131
Thank you. Thank you very much.

353
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,440
<i>Mais oui. Mais oui.</i>

354
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,851
But before you go anywhere,

355
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,088
could you please, pick a card, any card.

356
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,161
Not that card. Oh!

357
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,922
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

358
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,490
Okay. This one?

359
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,720
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

360
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,482
Okay, great.
Now if you could just sign your name there.

361
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,006
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

362
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,725
- That's good.
- Thanks.

363
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,001
Put it in your pocket.

364
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,727
And now for one tiny detail.

365
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,722
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

366
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,843
And I'll step off of it. <i>Bonne chance.</i>

367
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,170
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

368
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,882
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

369
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,167
One,

370
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,287
two...

371
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,407
Three.

372
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,920
What the fuck?

373
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,684
- Wow! Etienne?
- Whoa. Etienne?

374
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,763
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

375
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,967
Etienne?

376
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,562
I liked that little French guy.

377
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,807
Where did he go?

378
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,285
Wait, there he is.

379
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,648
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

380
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,769
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

381
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,041
- Etienne? Are you okay?
<i>- Yes.</i>

382
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,527
Perfect. What do you see in there?

383
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,606
Money.

384
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,121
Is this real?

385
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,760
Yes. Looks like three million or so
Euros' worth.

386
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,729
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

387
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,322
<i>I want you to take the card that you signed
out of your pocket.</i>

388
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,721
And I want you to take the ticket stub
from tonight's show

389
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,360
<i>and I want you to put it right there
in the middle of the money.</i>

390
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,281
Now drop it.

391
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,449
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

392
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,801
Don't press it just yet.

393
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,608
That button activates an air duct
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

394
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,165
<i>Okay, good. Now you can press it.</i>

395
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,881
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

396
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,490
Whoo!

397
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,365
Oh. Wait a second.

398
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,971
- Huh.

399
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,650
<i>Oh, merde.</i>

400
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,923
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

401
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,526
We are The Four Horsemen.

402
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,047
- And good night!
- Good night!

403
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,046
Hold up here.

404
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,726
Dylan Rhodes.

405
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,522
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

406
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,051
Did you say magicians?

407
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,884
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

408
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,361
<i>Where are you now?</i>

409
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,520
I'm at Aria.
I'm heading up there to grab 'em now.

410
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,569
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

411
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,091
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

412
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,241
<i>Uno minute.</i>

413
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,249
Let's go. Get 'em up.

414
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,771
Put the book down.

415
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,564
Okay. You got me.

416
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,280
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

417
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,565
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

418
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,081
Let's go.

419
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,763
<i>Boss, please tell me this is a joke.</i>

420
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,884
<i>I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.</i>

421
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,363
I'm a month, two tops,
away from blowing this whole thing open.

422
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,602
- Get Turkelson.
- He's in Atlantic City.

423
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,491
What about Cowan? Look at him.
He's just sitting there on his ass.

424
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,840
Hilarious, Rhodes.

425
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,406
I love you.

426
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,807
Asshole.

427
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,520
I don't have time for this magic crap.

428
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,166
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

429
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,321
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

430
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,010
Actually, 3.2.

431
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,411
- Who is she?

432
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,681
Who are you?

433
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,923
Alma Dray from Interpol.
I'll be working the investigation with you.

434
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,167
You gotta be kidding me.

435
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,200
It's bad enough they got me chasing down
David Copperfield and Friends.

436
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,403
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

437
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,720
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

438
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,770
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

439
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,002
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

440
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,001
Oh, you did?
You spoke to my witness before me?

441
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,204
Your witness?
I thought you didn't want the case.

442
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,004
Besides, he's useless.

443
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,770
Oh, really? Why is that?

444
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,122
Because he believes their magic was real.

445
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,369
Oh, he believes the magic was real?
You're right, he probably is useless.

446
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,524
Is it okay with Interpol
if we talk to him, too?

447
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,170
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

448
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,329
I have never stolen a
thing in my life, okay?

449
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,727
I tried to give the money back,
but they won't take it.

450
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,440
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

451
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,681
I did.

452
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,046
Fine. Fantastic. You did.

453
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,726
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

454
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,246
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

455
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,768
With the teleportation helmet.

456
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,520
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

457
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,244
He was hypnotized during the show.

458
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,409
I told you, he's useless.

459
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,290
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done
with this other bullshit.

460
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,801
Hey!

461
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,689
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

462
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,171
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

463
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,681
I guess that "bullshit"
was the trigger word.

464
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,889
Okay. Hey, hey. <i>Écoutez.</i>
Etienne, come on down from there.

465
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,200
You're not in the Philharmonic.

466
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,761
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

467
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,961
Tell him to stop.

468
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,370
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

469
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,324
Okay, I need a time-out.

470
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,930
Too many French people in one room.

471
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,570
- Agent Rhodes!
- Huh?

472
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,246
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

473
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,410
And until we have one, I'm
here, like it or not.

474
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,289
So we can work together,

475
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,530
or you can continue to follow behind
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

476
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,806
It's up to you.

477
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,487
Hmm.

478
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,800
I'm not finished.

479
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,761
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

480
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,922
And I do not handle jet lag well.

481
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,767
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

482
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,962
- I promise you, you will lose.
- Hmm.

483
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,209
Mm-hmm. Fine. So which one of these idiots
do you want to talk to first?

484
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,327
Him?

485
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,046
Dylan, for the record,

486
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,361
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

487
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,401
Okay.

488
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,290
That is to say, that it's not a science.
It's more for entertainment.

489
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,361
All right.

490
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,842
Just don't believe everything the guy says.
That's all.

491
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,648
Please convey my deepest apologies
to your colleague out there.

492
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,167
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

493
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,327
I was out of line.

494
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,686
Tranny Tuesday?

495
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,569
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

496
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,404
Or might not have, if you believe

497
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,801
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

498
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,568
But isn't there a proud tradition
in the FBI of men wearing dresses?

499
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,961
<i>No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.</i>

500
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,565
I'm just having fun.

501
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,047
Was this your card? No.

502
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,406
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

503
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,481
and I respect that.

504
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,449
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

505
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,567
but I understand protocol.

506
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,926
Okay, okay.

507
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,726
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

508
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,201
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

509
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,441
Oh, yes. That would be...

510
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,045
What do the kids call it these days?

511
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,320
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

512
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,203
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

513
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,529
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

514
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,008
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

515
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,164
It says here you are a mentalist.

516
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,370
- Hmm.
- What exactly is mentalism?

517
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,530
Tricks, mostly. Um, some science.

518
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,526
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

519
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,008
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

520
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,324
Voices in my head.

521
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,361
Says here you were fairly
famous at one point.

522
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,521
Mm-hmm.

523
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,529
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

524
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,246
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

525
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,322
- two TV specials.
- Glory days.

526
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,882
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

527
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,320
Did your research, did you?

528
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,204
IRS audit. Back taxes.

529
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,570
You've had a long hard slog back into the
limelight, haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

530
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,448
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

531
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,648
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

532
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,846
put on the magical helmet...

533
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,921
Listen to me.

534
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,526
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

535
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,801
Which makes you an accomplice.

536
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,326
So if you wanna walk out of here today,
I'd suggest you start...
